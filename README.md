# 🚀 Parallel Dijkstra's Algorithm (OpenMP + MPI + CUDA)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm** in three versions:
- **Sequential** (baseline)
- **Parallel with OpenMP**
- **Parallel with MPI**
- **Parallel with CUDA**

The goal is to compare performance and scalability across different parallelization strategies. Benchmarks and visualizations are included to demonstrate speedup and efficiency.
